Certainly! Here's a cheat sheet for using regular expressions in Go modules:

Regular Expression Basics:
- `.` - Matches any single character except a newline.
- `*` - Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.
- `+` - Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.
- `?` - Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element.
- `{n}` - Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding element.
- `{n,}` - Matches n or more occurrences of the preceding element.
- `{n,m}` - Matches at least n and at most m occurrences of the preceding element.
- `^` - Matches the start of the string.
- `$` - Matches the end of the string.
- `|` - Matches either the expression before or after the pipe.

Regular Expression Metacharacters:
- `\d` - Matches any digit character.
- `\D` - Matches any non-digit character.
- `\w` - Matches any word character (alphanumeric or underscore).
- `\W` - Matches any non-word character.
- `\s` - Matches any whitespace character.
- `\S` - Matches any non-whitespace character.

Anchors and Boundaries:
- `\b` - Matches a word boundary.
- `\B` - Matches a non-word boundary.
- `^` - Matches the start of a line.
- `$` - Matches the end of a line.

Character Classes:
- `[abc]` - Matches any single character a, b, or c.
- `[^abc]` - Matches any single character except a, b, or c.
- `[a-z]` - Matches any single character in the range a to z.
- `[A-Z]` - Matches any single character in the range A to Z.
- `[0-9]` - Matches any single digit.

Quantifiers:
- `*` - Matches zero or more occurrences.
- `+` - Matches one or more occurrences.
- `?` - Matches zero or one occurrence.
- `{n}` - Matches exactly n occurrences.
- `{n,}` - Matches n or more occurrences.
- `{n,m}` - Matches at least n and at most m occurrences.

Grouping and Capturing:
- `(exp)` - Matches the expression exp and captures the matched substring.
- `(?:exp)` - Matches the expression exp but does not capture the matched substring.
- `(?P<name>exp)` - Matches the expression exp and captures it into the named group "name".

Modifiers:
- `i` - Case-insensitive matching.
- `m` - Multi-line matching.
- `s` - Allows the `.` to match newline characters.
- `U` - Ungreedy matching.
- `x` - Ignores whitespace and allows comments within the pattern.

Example Usage:
```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    re := regexp.MustCompile(`\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b`)
    input := "Emails: john@example.com, jane@example.com"
    emails := re.FindAllString(input, -1)
    for _, email := range emails {
        fmt.Println(email)
    }
}
```

This example searches for email addresses in a given input string using a regular expression pattern. Adjust the pattern to match your specific use case.
